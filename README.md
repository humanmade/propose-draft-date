# Propose Draft Date

This is a WordPress plugin that provides an interface within the [block editor](https://developer.wordpress.org/blogk-editor) for contributing authors (and other roles without the ability to schedule or publish posts) to select a proposed date for the plugin. That proposed date will be shown in previews of the post by filtering the "floating" post date, and will take effect when the post is published.
